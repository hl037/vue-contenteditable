vue-contenteditable
===================

This plugin provides a ``<contenteditable/>`` element supporting ``v-model``. It also provides some (optional) features, like preventing html input / paste or new lines.

It is inpired by the nice (but limited by design) https://github.com/asconwe/vue-contenteditable-directive .

Contrary to ``vue-contenteditable-directive``, this plugin has full support of v-model reactivity.

Should you use a content editable ?
-----------------------------------

The response is generally **NO**.

But... there are edge cases where neither ``<input/>`` nor ``<textarea>`` could suit, for example when you need a dynamic object size to adapt to user input text size.

Installation
------------

With a build system
```````````````````

.. code:: 

    npm install --save vue-contenteditable

In your ``main.js`` :

.. code:: javascript

    import contenteditable from 'vue-contenteditable'
    Vue.use(contenteditable)

(Re)build
`````````

The needed files are already provided in ``dist/``, but if you want to re build, simlply run :

.. code::

    npm run build

Directely in html
`````````````````

.. code:: html

	 <script src="contenteditable.min.js"></script>

Usage

    </template>
     
    <script>
    export default {
      data() {
        return {
          isEditable: true,
          message: "hello"
        }
      },
      methods : {
        enterPressed(){
          alert('Enter Pressed');
        }
